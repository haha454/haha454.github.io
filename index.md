This is Zunhao, a software engineer based in Singapore. My expertise is mainly in building large scale data-intensive web applications. I also have a few years of C++ experience building low-level software components such as device driver communication.

My hobbies include playing Starcraft and basketball. I used to be a semi-pro Starcraft player and I still play the game now and then. I am an active amateur basketball player.
